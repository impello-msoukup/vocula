# What is the Vocula app?

Vocula is an open source content provider powered by REST API and based on simplicity of Markdown and YAML files. These files combine content (text & images) and metadata structured into a directory tree.

The main advantage of Vocula application is the user-friendliness of fast creation of structured information source. Vocula brings the ability to **focus on content** instead of complicated setup.

Created content could be used as source for **websites** or as **knowledge base** repository and could be combined and integrated with another solutions.
